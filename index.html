    <h1>Making a webpage with GitHub, by Dale Canyon</h1>
    <p>Before interfacing with GitHub, it's helpful to do the following:</p>
    
    <p>1) Consolidate images for your webpage into a designated folder or directory</p>
    <p>2) Write your code using a code editor (ex: VS Code)</p>
    <p>3) Make sure images and the index.html file are in the same location</p>
    <p>Here's an example from a tutorial video using VS Code:</p>
    <img src="./yeehaw7.png" />
    <p>REMEBER: if the images and index.html file aren't stored in the same location, that dog won't hunt.</p>
    

    <p>Now let's DO THIS:</p>
    <img src="./yeehaw.png" />
    <p>On the next page...</p>
    <img src="./yeehaw2.png" />
    <p>Scroll down all the way to the bottom and...</p>
    <img src="./yeehaw3.png" />
    <p>Keep going!</p>
    <img src="yeehaw4.png" />
    <p>This screen will pop up. You know what to do.</p>
    <img src="yeehaw5.png" />
    <p>ALMOST DONE!!!</p>
    <img src="yeehaw6.png" />
    <p>Congratulations! You should now be able to access your webpage via the repository address you created in step 3. Enjoy your new webpage with pets and loved ones!</p>
